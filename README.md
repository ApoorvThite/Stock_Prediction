## Introduction
Stock market prediction is a highly complex and challenging task due to the dynamic and volatile nature of financial markets. This project aims to use machine learning to predict stock prices, providing a foundation for developing more sophisticated trading strategies.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Project Structure
* Stock_Prediction.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* requirements.txt: List of required libraries and dependencies.

## Models and Techniques
This project utilizes the following techniques and libraries:
* Data Collection and Preprocessing
  * yfinance for fetching historical stock data.
  * pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
  * MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.
* Modeling:
  * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network using Keras for sequence prediction.
* Visualization:
  * Matplotlib for plotting and visualizing data trends and model performance.

## Results
The results section should include an analysis of the model's performance, including metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and visualizations comparing the predicted and actual stock prices.
